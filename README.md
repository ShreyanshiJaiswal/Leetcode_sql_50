# SQL50 Study Plan ‚Äì My Progress Tracker üìò

Hey! This repo is basically my journey through the [LeetCode SQL50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) problems.  
I started this because I didn‚Äôt just want to solve questions and forget them later. I wanted a place where I could track what I‚Äôve done, keep my solutions in one place, and also write down how I thought about each problem in the simplest way possible.  

## How I‚Äôm keeping things
LeetCode divides SQL50 into different sections, so I decided to follow the same idea here. For each section, I‚Äôve made a folder. Inside the folder, there‚Äôs a README file that has all the questions from that section.  

Every question has three things:
1. The title of the problem, linked directly to LeetCode (so you can open it easily).  
2. My SQL query.  
3. A short explanation of how I approached it.  

Instead of dumping everything in one huge file, I felt this way makes it cleaner and easier to go through later.  

## Why I‚Äôm doing this
Honestly, this is not just to ‚Äúshow progress.‚Äù I really want to get better at SQL, and the best way to learn (at least for me) is to write things down and explain them. If someone else checks this repo, I hope it also helps them see how I solved a problem without overcomplicating it.  

It‚Äôs like my little notebook, just digital and public. By the time I‚Äôm done, I want this to be something I can look back at and say‚Äîyes, I worked through all of SQL50 step by step, and here‚Äôs exactly how I did it.  

## Progress
I‚Äôll keep adding to the folders as I go along. Slowly but surely, the full SQL50 will be here. Let‚Äôs see how it turns out :)
