# Leetcode_sql_50
This repo is my record of solving 50 SQL problems from LeetCode. For each problem, Iâ€™ve added the question link, my SQL solution, and a simple explanation of my thought process. I also keep a mistake log to note the errors I made and what I learned from them. The goal is to practice, track my progress, and have a reference to improve my SQL skills.
