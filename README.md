# SQL Practice 📘

Hey! This repo is my space to keep track of all the SQL problems I’m solving.  
I started this because I didn’t just want to solve and forget. I wanted a place where I could store everything, look back later, and also write down my thought process in the simplest way possible.  

## How I’m keeping things
I’ll be dividing problems based on the platform (like LeetCode, InterviewBit, StrataScratch, etc.).  
Inside each platform, there will be folders for topics or sections, and in each folder, a README file with:  
1. The question (with a link to the platform).  
2. My SQL solution.  
3. A short explanation of how I solved it.  

This way it stays clean and organized, and I can easily find things later.  

## Why I’m doing this
Not just for “showing progress” — but to actually get better at SQL. Writing things down helps me learn, and if anyone else ever looks at this repo, I hope it makes sense to them too.  

It’s like my little digital notebook, just public. Slowly, I’ll keep adding from different platforms and build this step by step.
