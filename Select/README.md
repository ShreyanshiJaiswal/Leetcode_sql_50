### [1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```sql
SELECT product_id 
FROM Products 
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```
## Thought Process
- The table contains product details.
- We only want products that are **both** low fat and recyclable.
- That means two conditions should be true at the same time.
- I used the `WHERE` clause with:
    `low_fats = 'Y'`
    `recyclable = 'Y'`
- The `AND` ensures both conditions are satisfied together.
- Final output â†’ product IDs that meet both conditions.
