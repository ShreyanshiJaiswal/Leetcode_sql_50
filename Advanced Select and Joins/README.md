### [1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-employees-which-report-to-each-employee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```sql
SELECT 
    m.employee_id,
    m.name,
    COUNT(e.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(e.age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees e
JOIN Employees m
    ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
GROUP BY m.employee_id, m.name
ORDER BY m.employee_id;
```
## Thought Process
- Goal: Find how many employees report to each manager and their average age.  
- Step 1: Use a **self-join** on the `Employees` table:  
  - `e` = employee (the one who reports)  
  - `m` = manager (the one being reported to).  
- Step 2: Match with `ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id`.  
- Step 3: For each manager, count how many employees report to them â†’ `COUNT(e.employee_id)`.  
- Step 4: Calculate the average age of these reporting employees â†’ `AVG(e.age)`, rounded with `ROUND()`.  
- Step 5: Group results by `m.employee_id` and `m.name` (since each managerâ€™s summary is required).  
- Step 6: Order by `m.employee_id` for a clean ascending order list.  

ðŸ“Œ This ensures we see each manager, how many direct reports they have, and the average age of their team members.

### [1789. Primary Department for Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/primary-department-for-each-employee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
   OR employee_id IN (
        SELECT employee_id
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY employee_id
        HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1
   );
```
## Thought Process
- The task is to return the primary department of each employee.  
- Two cases exist:
  1. If an employee has multiple departments, only the row with `primary_flag = 'Y'` should be selected.  
  2. If an employee has only one department, that department must be selected, even if its `primary_flag` is not `'Y'`.  
- To solve:
  - First, select rows where `primary_flag = 'Y'`.  
  - Next, add employees who belong to exactly one department using `GROUP BY employee_id HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1`.  
- This ensures we capture both single-department employees and multi-department employees with a defined primary.
